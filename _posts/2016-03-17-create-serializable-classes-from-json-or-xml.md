Something I wish I would have known sooner, you can create models based on a json or xml file in Visual Studio.  Just go to EDIT -> Paste special and select whatever format you may have.  You must be in a .cs file for it to work.

This saves so much time.  Here is a StackOverflow article about it: [ http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4203540/generate-c-sharp-class-from-xml](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4203540/generate-c-sharp-class-from-xml)
