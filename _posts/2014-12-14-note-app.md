    I wanted to write an HTML 5 application and really dive into javascript. This project is HTML 5 with Angular.js on the client side and node.js with nedb database on the server side. All of the code is on my github page for examples: <a href="https://github.com/supermitsuba/NotesApp">https://github.com/supermitsuba/NotesApp</a>.
  </p>

    I wanted to know more about javascript frameworks, especially using some of the new features in HTML 5. Using local storage and offline caching, the application can be ran with or without a network connection. When it can connect to the server, it calls a web API to store the notes into a local database, nedb. Nedb is like a local, no sql, append database.
  </p>

    With all the javascript, I wanted some help with typing. So, I decided to try typescript on the client side. This worked well to identify issues with function calls and types. What helped with the development was grunt, because it would watch for changes and compile the typescript into javascript.
  </p>

    Ultimately, this has been a fun project to work on and it has made me more comfortable with all these different technologies.
