 <p> It has been a while, cause I have been avoiding the weather, but I have been working on something at work that is awesome. We have released, to the open source community, RAMLSharp. This project takes your ASP.Net Web API project and converts it to RAML. </p> <p> We wanted an easy way for developers to develop RAML, as it is a nice open source standard (www.raml.org). Unfortunately, the tools around RAML were just for javascript, Java, Ruby and PHP. Today at Quicken Loans, we released RAMLSharp as a project that can be used to help bridge that gap for .Net developers. </p> <p> Looking at ASP.Net Web API Help Pages, we took the tools for that and modified them to help us build RAMLSharp. You can check out our code at: <a href="https://github.com/QuickenLoans/RAMLsharp">https://github.com/QuickenLoans/RAMLsharp</a> or if you want a nuget package of it, check out: <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/RamlSharp/">https://www.nuget.org/packages/RamlSharp/</a> </p>
