Hello all.  I have since switched from Quicken Loans to Panasonic, and it is a big switch.  I now am in the Ruby space, which means relearning all the tools I once knew.  But it&#8217;s not all bad, Ruby has many similarities that make it easy to jump into.  I wanted to chat about those similarities and what I have seen so far in Ruby, compared to .net.

Here is a quick list of things I have noticed so far:

  1. ruby -> C#
  2. ruby on rails -> ASP.net MVC/Web API
  3. ActiveRecord -> Entity framework
  4. gem -> nuget
  5. bundler -> nuget install
  6. modules -> extension methods
  7.  puts -> console

So that&#8217;s a quick list of what I have compiled so far as the shift in tools I have known.  Its not to bad, although I did create a Vagrant VM to save my development environment, which I could never do on windows without imaging everything.  But I do hate to debug in the console for some reason, I am hoping I get over that too.  Since I got my VM and now a simple [Rest API](https://github.com/supermitsuba/SMSpiRuby) under my belt, I should be good for next week.
