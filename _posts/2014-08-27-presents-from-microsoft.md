 <p> Thanks Microsoft! A while back I signed up for a windows on devices program. Today, I just got a new Intel Galileo, a device that is suppose to be a Raspberry PI/Arduino clone from Intel. The cool thing is that this device is running Windows on it. </p> <p> A friend of mine told me about the <a href="https://www.windowsondevices.com/signup.aspx">Microsoft on Devices program</a> and said I should sign up for it. There were a bunch of questions about your development background, and even a spot for a website. So, I threw my hat in the race to see if they would want me to build something. Looks like YES! Last week, I got an email about Microsoft sending me a development kit to build something cool. You bet I&#8217;m going to build something fun!!! </p> <p> In the kit, I got several things: </p> <img src="/img/galileo.jpg" style="width:40%" class="img-responsive" /> <ul> <li>1) An Intel Galileo</li> <li>2) LED</li> <li>3) Ethernet Cable</li> <li>4) USB to Ethernet adapter</li> <li>5) SD Card w/ Windows for Intel Galileo</li> </ul> <p> So, in my previous hardware project, I used a Raspberry PI and Arduino to build an <a href="/title/LED\_Bulletin\_Board">LED Bulletin Board</a>. While I could swap out the Raspberry PI and Ardunio for this, I think I should come up with something new. If you got some ideas or thoughts on projects, add a comment. I will be looking into it for Labor Day. </p>
