 <p> It&#8217;s been a while since I have wrote my last article, but I thought I would start with something easy. Euler is a great way to learn any language, but for me, I used it to get use to the basics of javascript. </p> <p> If you haven&#8217;t heard of project Euler, then check out the site here: <a href="http://projecteuler.net/">http://projecteuler.net/</a>. Whether you are practicing for an interview, or learning a new language, this site will give you some questions to get your brain hurting like a Discrete Mathematics class. Most of the questions are math problems. For the first 10 questions, you will be solving prime number questions, which to me, felt like I was thinking about the rules of what you need to program. There are hundreds of questions, and they progress in difficultly, so this is a great way to sharpen your skills and train on a new language. So give it a try. </p>
