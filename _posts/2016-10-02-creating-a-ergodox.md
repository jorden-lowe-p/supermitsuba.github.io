The ergodox!
 I recently purchased an ergodox.  The keyboard is one where I would have to put together.  All of it, except the pcb and some of the controlling unit.  The switches I choose was Zealios 65g purple.  I had a pok3r keyboard with Cherry MX clears, but I wanted to try the lighter keys out.  I personally would keep the clears.  I like the added force that they have over say a Cherry MX blues, but did not want the force of a MX green. Here are some pictures:

Before you say that looks like alot of work, it actually takes a few hours to build.  Most of my time was spent mastering soldering, which before then I had not done such a large project before.  But it was easy and I had no problems after.  I am glad to have done the project and now I am thinking of desoldering all the led's and keys again so i can replace them with MX clears :-).
